## Deferred to a later round (NOT vendored in R1)
These anvaka libraries ship only as CommonJS-with-deep-`require()`-trees or as
un-built TypeScript source. Without an npm/bundler step in the offline build sandbox
they cannot be turned into a single self-contained browser global safely, so they are
**deferred** rather than shipped half-wired:

- **ngraph.three** (`index.js` requires `three`, `ngraph.merge`, `ngraph.forcelayout3d`,
  `three.trackball`) — deep require tree.
- **three.map.control** (`index.js` requires `wheel`, `ngraph.events`, `amator`,
  `./lib/kinetic`) — deep require tree.
- **ngraph.cw** (`index.js` requires `ngraph.random`) — small but unbundled.
- **w-gl** (`index.ts` + `src/` TypeScript only, no prebuilt `build/`/`dist/`) — needs a
  TS bundler.

3D tabs are instead driven by the already-vendored **`ngraph.forcelayout`
`{dimensions:3}`** deterministic layout (the core "upgrade engine") rendered with the
already-in-image **`three.min.js` + `3d-force-graph.min.js`** — fully 0-CDN. Re-vendor the
four deferred libs once a one-time offline bundle pass is available.
