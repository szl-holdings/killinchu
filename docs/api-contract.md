# API Contract — killinchu v1.0
**Doctrine v11 LOCKED 749/14/163 | SLSA L1 honest | Version: 1.0.0**  
**Updated:** 2026-06-03

This document is the canonical API contract for the `killinchu` flagship.
It is versioned with the code release (see `CHANGELOG.md` for history).

## Base URL

```
https://szlholdings-killinchu.hf.space
```

## Authentication

No API key required for public endpoints. All responses include doctrine invariants.

## Doctrine Invariants in All Responses

Every JSON response from `killinchu` includes:

```json
{
  "doctrine": "v11",
  "declarations": 749,
  "axioms_unique": 14,
  "sorries_total": 163
}
```

These values are LOCKED. Any deviation is a bug.

## Core Endpoints

### GET `/api/killinchu/v1/lambda`

Returns the 13-axis Lambda (Λ) trust aggregation score.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "trust_axes": 13,
  "axes": [{"name": "soundness", "score": 0.92}, ...],
  "lambda": 0.91911,
  "lambda_floor": 0.90,
  "pass": true,
  "aggregate": "geometric mean (yuyay_v3 canonical, 13-axis)",
  "uniqueness": "Conjecture 1 — NOT a Theorem",
  "declarations": 749,
  "axioms_unique": 14,
  "sorries_total": 163,
