"""Mirror the Dockerfile-COPY'd backend (.py + Dockerfile) to the HuggingFace Space.

This is the extracted, unit-testable form of the backend-mirror logic the
hf-sync.yml `mirror-app` job runs. The job invokes this module directly so the
SAME code that runs in CI is exercised by tests/test_hf_sync_backend.py.

The Space is built from THIS repo's Dockerfile, so the files it COPYs are exactly
the backend the image runs. We mirror the .py among them so the Space never builds
from a stale backend, plus the Dockerfile itself (so a newly-added module's COPY
line reaches the Space and gets baked in). We push ONLY the files whose content
differs from the Space's current copy (git-blob-OID compare), so an unchanged set
is a true no-op and never triggers a needless Space rebuild.

NOTE ON THE COMPUTED MIRROR SET vs env.APP_FILES: killinchu's hf-sync.yml gates
the `mirror-app` job on env.APP_FILES (the hand-maintained trigger list kept in
lockstep with on.push.paths). The set this module actually mirrors + sweeps is the
FULL set the image is built from — every .py the Dockerfile COPYs, plus serve.py
and the Dockerfile — exactly like the sibling szl-holdings/a11oy hf-sync-backend.
That is deliberate: the delete keep-set MUST cover every backend module the Space
needs, and APP_FILES is only a curated subset, so using it as the keep-set would
wrongly delete the ~80 other Dockerfile-COPY'd modules. Editing the Dockerfile
COPY set (which any backend add/remove does) is in env.APP_FILES, so a module
deletion still triggers this job and the sweep below.

auto factory-rebuild (drift-fix): an HF Space commit LANDS the new files but does
NOT rebuild the running Docker container — the Space keeps serving the OLD image
until a *factory* rebuild. So mirroring the backend via create_commit alone never
makes the new code actually go live. After a real commit, main() calls
restart_space(factory_reboot=True) so the mirrored backend serves with no manual
step. It is gated on a real commit: an in-sync run makes no commit and triggers NO
rebuild (avoids a needless multi-minute Docker rebuild). The rebuild outcome is
surfaced in the run log — success prints a ::notice:: with the resulting runtime
stage; a failed request prints a loud ::error:: (mirrored-but-stale) and re-raises
so a silent rebuild failure can't leave the Space serving the old container.

delete-aware backend sync (drift-fix): the add/update-only path above left a stale
copy on the Space whenever a backend module was DELETED from the repo AND dropped
from the Dockerfile COPY set — the orphaned .py lingered in the Space tree forever.
It is harmless to the built image (no longer COPY'd) but makes the Space tree drift
from GitHub and confuses the hf-module-drift-check guard. select_deletions() now
diffs the Space's current .py tree against the computed mirror set and emits a
delete for any backend .py no longer in the mirror.

whole-directory removal (drift-fix): the first delete pass scoped deletions to the
directories the mirror still populates (managed_backend_dirs, derived from the
mirror itself). That left one edge case open: when an ENTIRE backend subdirectory
is dropped from the repo + Dockerfile COPY set, no .py from it survives in the
mirror, so the dir falls out of managed_backend_dirs and its orphaned .py were
never swept — the Space tree kept drifting from GitHub. The delete pass now also
sweeps backend .py in directories that are NOT a protected front-door / built-asset
/ vendor location (NON_BACKEND_PREFIXES via is_protected_path), so a wholly-removed
backend dir's modules are cleaned up too.

Deletion stays scoped to backend .py paths ONLY: a Space path is a delete candidate
iff it ends in .py, is not a *.bak* backup, is not still in the mirror, and EITHER
lives in a directory this sync actively populates (managed_backend_dirs) OR is not
under a protected prefix. This can NEVER touch README (.md), the front-door
pages/*.{html,js} + web/*.{html,js} files owned by hf-sync.yml, the built SPA
bundles (static/), or LFS/vendor blobs (static/, static-vendor/, etc.) — they are
either non-.py or live under a NON_BACKEND_PREFIXES path the sweep refuses to enter.
A denylist of those few stable HF-Space front-door/vendor roots is used here
(rather than a hardcoded allowlist of backend dirs) precisely so a relocated or
wholly-removed backend dir is still cleaned up without code changes.

Pure helpers (no huggingface_hub dependency): git_blob_sha1, parse_dockerfile_copy_srcs,
expand_py_files, build_mirror_set, select_changed_files, managed_backend_dirs,
is_protected_path, select_deletions, sync_to_space, factory_rebuild,
sync_and_maybe_rebuild. main() lazily imports huggingface_hub so the test suite can
run network-free with pure stdlib.

Credential: HF_WRITE_TOKEN (HF write token with org-write to SZLHOLDINGS). The
legacy HF_TOKEN secret is retired on killinchu; HF_TOKEN is still accepted as a
fallback env so a local run with either name works.
