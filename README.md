# a11oy

This repository is the **source** for the product origin
[https://a-11-oy.com](https://a-11-oy.com).
Proof lives at [https://a11oy.net](https://a11oy.net).

`a11oy.com` is not a surface of this project.

a11oy is a governed-AI Command Center: deny-by-default policy, trust
ceiling 0.97, and a hash-chained receipt for every decision (DSSE signing
PARTIAL — see Honest status). This tree is
that system's source. It is not the proof registry.

## Invariant

**receipts.in ≡ receipts.out**

A governed action is admitted only as a signed receipt and leaves only
as that same signed receipt. The two sides are identical. A mismatch
is a failed verification, not a display error.

## Live surfaces

Measured 2026-09-04: the apex `a-11-oy.com` serves the Space runtime
(`server=szl`, `x-szl-space: a11oy`). Hugging Face `runtime.domains`
lists `a-11-oy.com` as **READY**. HTTP 200 is reachability, not a
production certificate. `www.a-11-oy.com` TLS is **UNAVAILABLE**.

## The proof backbone

The trust math behind a11oy is pinned in **Lean 4** and checked by a proof machine:

- **8 formulas locked-proven** in lutar-lean [`Lutar/Puriq/Formulas/ProvedFormulas.lean` @ `3a886349`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean/blob/3a8863491f688956f2fae7796e31404d6b21c8a6/Lutar/Puriq/Formulas/ProvedFormulas.lean) (file added 2026-06-04, last changed 2026-06-10; not present at `c7c0ba17`). What they state: pure-function replay determinism (F1, `f x = f x`), acyclicity kept when backward-pointing edges are appended to a Khipu DAG (F4), FIFO drain order on a list-modelled queue (F7), integer add-then-subtract cancellation (F11), `Nat` distributivity (F12), RS(10,6) parity-count arithmetic (F18, `10 − 6 = 4`), `Nat` additive monotonicity (F19), and strictly increasing indices in a `List.range` sequence log (F22). They do not prove receipt-replay integrity or Reed–Solomon recovery. The Doctrine v11 figure 749/14/163 @ `c7c0ba17` is a separate count: its 163 counts `sorry` text including comments, and the 149 variant drops only lines that start with `--`, so neither is a count of open proof holes.
- **Λ unconditional uniqueness = Conjecture 1** — machine-checked false (we found a counterexample). Conditional uniqueness is proven axiom-free (Theorem U). We say both out loud.
- **SLSA L1 honest · L2 build-attested · L3 roadmap**. No government authorization or accreditation is claimed.

### Persistent receipt storage (HF Space)

The protected deployment workflow attaches the existing
`SZLHOLDINGS/szl-evidence` Storage Bucket read-write at `/data`, preserving any
other attached volumes and failing closed if another volume already claims that
mount. The Series-A database is namespaced at:

```
A11OY_SERIES_A_DB=/data/a11oy/series-a/control-plane.sqlite3
```

Production also sets `A11OY_REQUIRE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=1`,
`A11OY_SERIES_A_REQUIRE_MOUNT=/data`, and the network-filesystem-safe SQLite
rollback journal. If the bucket is detached or the database path escapes the
mount, Series-A registration fails closed instead of falling back to `/tmp`.
The unified Khipu and energy ledgers use separate `/data/a11oy/*` paths.

**Required HF Space secrets for full signing integrity:**
- `SZL_COSIGN_PRIVATE_PEM` — canonical ECDSA P-256 private PEM shared by all
  receipt surfaces. The deployment sets `A11OY_REQUIRE_PERSISTENT_SIGNING=1`,
  so an absent or malformed key disables signing instead of minting a
  replacement identity.

Check current signing and storage status at `GET /api/a11oy/v1/signing-status`
and `GET /api/a11oy/v1/series-a/status` on the product origin.

`GET /api/a11oy/v1/attest/manifest` and `GET /api/a11oy/v1/attest/verify`
are read-only inspections: they do not sign, submit to Rekor, or append ledger
receipts, even when those providers are configured. The manifest reports
`UNSIGNED-READ-ONLY` and `lake.status=READ_ONLY`; requiring unavailable
transparency evidence returns `UNKNOWN`. Explicit write callers can use the
existing signing and receipt functions. Source tests cover this contract;
deployment still requires the canonical publisher and live readback.

## Truth gates

Round-10 payload wiring: three stdlib-first gates plus the 12-step acceptance
demo, run by the `truth-gates` workflow on every PR and push.

```bash
python3 tools/docs_lexicon_gate.py       # docs language gate: banned phrases, empty truth states
python3 tools/commercial_release_gate.py # commercial truth gate: COMMERCIAL_LEDGER + claims-ledger
python3 tools/demo_harness.py --conformance evidence/conformance/eu-ai-act-article-12.v1.yaml
```

Expected first-run exit codes: `docs_lexicon_gate.py` **1** and
`commercial_release_gate.py` **1** — those failures are intended. The lexicon
output is the Week 1 documentation fix list; the release-gate output is the 24
raise-blocking COMMERCIAL_LEDGER rows still `UNKNOWN` (the real work, per the
funding discipline). `demo_harness.py` must stay **0** (12/12 steps) on every
PR. The two observe-mode gates run `continue-on-error` until their finding
lists reach zero; flip procedure: `docs/RUNBOOK_WEEK1.md`.

Naming note (no file was overwritten): `tools/lexicon_gate.py` and
`tools/release_gate.py` already exist here as the round-5 gates, so the
round-10 gates are wired under the names above; both generations run. The
v1 Article 12 logging conformance profile lives at
`evidence/conformance/eu-ai-act-article-12.v1.yaml` because the CANON path is
occupied by an older, structurally different artifact. Fresh scaffolds are
created non-destructively with `python3 tools/szl_master_bootstrap.py --run`.

---

## Shared modules (must not drift)

`a11oy_agent_loop.py`, `a11oy_mcp_client.py`, and `operator_shell_v4.py` are **SHARED
byte-identical** with the sibling [killinchu](https://github.com/szl-holdings/killinchu)
deployment and must not drift. An in-repo ratchet pins their SHA-256 in
`.shared_module_hashes.json`; the `Shared-module hash lock` workflow fails if any of
them changes without the lock being regenerated. When a change is intentional,
regenerate the lock in the same PR and mirror the edit to killinchu (cross-repo
enforcement is a follow-up):

```
python3 .github/shared-module-hash-check.py --update
```

## Governed Delta Workspace

> Runtime write status is configuration-bound. GDW reports `REAL` only when its
> secret-managed credential registry, canonical governance gates, verified
> persistent storage, exact schema, and a fresh generation-bound supervised
> outbox pass are ready.
> Otherwise it reports `UNAVAILABLE` and writes fail closed.
>
> The public deployment remains `UNAVAILABLE` until this corrective source is
> protected-merged, exact-source relocked, and the production credential and
> persistence contracts are observed live. Source tests are not deployment
> evidence.

> GDW Frontier Push Pack is a MODELED instrumentation and verification extension for the Governed Delta Workspace. It provides load testing, operator validation, hybrid scheduling research hooks, KDA-vs-MLA memory benchmarking, and Lean-oriented proof export. It does not claim frontier benchmark superiority, proprietary activation access, or production-scale guarantees beyond the measured harness outputs.

The authenticated runtime, Postman collection, load tools, offline dashboard,
memory benchmark, proof-input bridge, and fail-closed readiness conditions are documented in
[`docs/gdw-frontier.md`](docs/gdw-frontier.md). A checked theorem is reported
separately from an exported theorem input, and every throughput result is scoped
to its captured run.
